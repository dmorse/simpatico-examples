System:

    800 atoms with WCA (repulsive Lennard-Jones) interactions
    NVT MD simulation, Nose-Hoover integrator

Usage:

   Run and restart MD simulation using run script.

       ./run [log]

     Outputs of the original run are output to subdirectory out/.
     Outputs of the restarted run are output to subdirectory rst/ .
     The optional [log] parameter, if present, specifies the name
     of a log file. If absent, log information is written to the
     screen.

   NVE md simulation:
   
       mdSim -e -p param -c commands
   
   Restarting NVE or NVT MD simulations
   
       mdSim -e -r restart -c commands.rst

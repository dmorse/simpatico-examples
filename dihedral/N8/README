All simulations in this directory tree are simulations of 100 
chains of 8 atoms each with angle and dihedral potentials. All 
of these examples use one of two initial configuration files in 
the "in/" subdirectory of this directory. 

These simulations all require versions of the main programs that 
have been compiled with angle and dihedral potentials enabled.
This features can be enabled by entering

> ./configure -a1 -d1

either from the simpatico/ root directory or the build directory
(bld/parallel, bld/serial or src/) before compiling.
